import requests

STOCK = "IBM"
COMPANY_NAME = "Tesla Inc"

STOCK_ENDPOINT = "https://www.alphavantage.co/query"
NEWS_ENDPOINT = "https://newsapi.org/v2/everything"

#STOCK_API="BLIRQS4WFYSLH0N9"
parameter={
"function":"TIME_SERIES_DAILY",
"symbol":STOCK,
"apikey":STOCK_API

}


## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything

r = requests.get(STOCK_ENDPOINT,params=parameter)
data = r.json()["Time Series (Daily)"]
data_list=[value for key,value in data.items()]
diff=abs(float(data_list[1]['4. close'])-float(data_list[0]['4. close']))
perc=(diff/float(data_list[0]['4. close']))*100






## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator


if perc>1:
    parameter2 = {
        #'apiKey': 'eeef6001cf314d7ba80e1a91cf4bf57b',
        'q': 'Apple'
    }

    response = requests.get(NEWS_ENDPOINT,params=parameter2)

    print (response.json)

## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.



#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
